C - learn to implement

Play with these simple programs on your own! I will add more code snippet. 

Do not expect direct answers! This way you will not miss the fun of learning and discovering them by yourself. 

**Compiler**: I highly recommend using **clang** (a front-end from LLVM project) for C because of its verbose and more descriptive message diagnostics, especially when things go not-as-you-desired. You should be spending more time to solve the problems rather than working on strange looking and mis-placed error messages as produced by gcc.
