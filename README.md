# Cimpl
C - learn to implement

Play with these simple programs on your own! I will add more code snippets. 

Do not expect direct answers! The idea is you should not miss out on the fun of learning and discovering things by yourself.   

**Compiler**: I highly recommend using **clang** (a front-end from the LLVM project) for C/C++ because of its verbose and more descriptive message diagnostics, especially when things go not-as-you-desired. You should be spending more time solving the problems rather than working on strange-looking and misplaced error messages as produced by others.   

**Online playground**: cplayground.com - for C/C++ programmers to quickly try out and check things! Also, see onlinegdb.com and compare both for the output, error messages, and warnings displayed.

Coding Style: Develop a code indentation and spacing habit. Indentation is vital in programming for better readability. Who will read or accept (merge) your code without indentation? Start this good habit when you start coding.    

[Who can describe CodingStyle better than Linux Kernel herself!](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)

**Practice**: 
Try solving some of the problems listed under [Project Euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives).   
Another reference for practice problems is [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java)

[devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/c/types/limits) has another handy online documentation.    
Official [ISO/IEC 9899 standard - 2007 version](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf) and [ISO/IEC 9899 - 2011 version](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf) <== clearly not for the first-year undergraduate students.    

Online course: You can explore a course [CS50 at Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) or [CS50 on edX](https://www.edx.org/cs50) by Prof David Malan (.../2021/2022). Prof David is awesome at introducing concepts and engaging the students. Malan's energy level keeps you connected, and it is that you will enjoy and remember.

Gotcha!    

The compiler has limitations and can sometimes do some interesting [**Implicit Conversions**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/assignment-conversions?view=msvc-170).    

Some more [memory related topics](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/C-Programming%2C-Part-3%3A-Common-Gotchas).    

Do not waste your time on such gotcha questions! There are in good supply, like Silo :)    
However, understand them; they are there, and maybe your professor likes to ask something you cannot answer in one shot.

**TODO**    
Add details on C and C++ standards.
