# Cimpl
C - learn to implement

Play with these simple programs on your own! I will add more code snippets. 

Do not expect direct answers! The idea is you should not miss out on the fun of learning and discovering things by yourself.   

**Compiler**: I highly recommend using **clang** (a front-end from the LLVM project) for C/C++ because of its verbose and more descriptive message diagnostics, especially when things go not-as-you-desired. You should be spending more time solving the problems rather than working on strange-looking and misplaced error messages as produced by others.   

**Online playground**: cplayground.com - for C/C++ programmers to quickly try out and check things! Also, see onlinegdb.com and compare both for the output, error messages, and warnings displayed.    


**Practice**: 
Try solving some of the problems listed under [Project Euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives).   
Another reference for practice problems is [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java)

The compiler has limitations and can sometimes do some interesting [**Implicit Conversions**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/assignment-conversions?view=msvc-170).   


**TODO**
Add details on C and C++ standards.
